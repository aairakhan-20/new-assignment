<p>Lists are the no. of items or any name that we mention in a specific sequence or in unsequence. We use bullets while making unsequence lists and use numbers or alphabets while making sequence lists. sequence and unsequence lists are called <b>order</b> and <b>unorder</b> lists respectively. We can make the lists in HTML using <b>ol</b> and <b>ul</b> tags.</p>
<p>Some examples of lists are:</p>
